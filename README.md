#SmartHire AI
An Explainable & Intelligent Recruitment Screening System
SmartHire AI addresses the “Black Box” problem in recruitment by introducing a transparent, explainable, and data-driven candidate evaluation framework.
Traditional ATS systems rely heavily on keyword matching, often ignoring context, experience depth, and real skill confidence.
SmartHire AI replaces this with a weighted skill intelligence pipeline that benefits both HR teams and candidates.
